## GAN- Tutorials

As we know there are many types of GANs, this is the tutorial to understand the math behind the various enhancements of GAN and implementation of source code with different open datasets.

Below is the order it is implemented:

**GAN**: Generative Adversarial Networks

**DCGAN**: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

**CGAN**: Conditional Generative Adversarial Network

**CycleGAN**

**CoGAN**: Coupled Generative Adversarial Networks

**ProGAN**: Progressive growing of Generative Adversarial 
Networks

**WGAN**: Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks

**SAGAN**: Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks

**BigGAN**: Big Generative Adversarial Networks

**StyleGAN**: Style-based Generative Adversarial Networks

Roughly it covers all the GANs. There are more left, which will added later.
